Volumization
TEF
Circadian timing


Volumization:
more food + less calories

Volumizing emphasizes the consumption of low-calorie, high-volume foods that are high in water and fiber. 
The main idea is to enhance one's feelings of fullness and satiety while minimizing calorie intake.

The best ways to volumize your food:
Add high volume foods to every meal
Eat at least 30 grams (or more) of protein with each meal
Avoid liquid calories
Drink water before and after a meal

Foods that contain the most volume:
Leafy green vegetables (lettuce, spinach, kale, etc.)
Cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli, etc.)
Stem and other vegetables (peppers, onions, zucchini, celery, etc.)
Fruit (especially citrus fruits and berries)


#2 - TEF aka. The Thermic Effect of Food
Proteins, in particular, are the rockstars of TEF. They demand a lot of energy to break down with 20-30% of their calories going into digestion alone.
Compare that to fats, which only use up about 0-3%, and carbs, which use around 5-10%.

#3 - The Circadian Timing of Meals
eat:7am-7pm
eat breakfast early or shortly after dawn
get sunlight exposure during the day
plan meals at consistent, predictable times

fast: 7pm-7am
drink only water and avoid eating at night
avoid artificial light in evenings
keep the lights low at night
